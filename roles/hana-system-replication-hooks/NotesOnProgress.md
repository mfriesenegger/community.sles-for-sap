# What do

Need to configure the sudoers file.

Need to bring in sys rep site name variables - could probably query for these.

Need to check for valid sys rep status

Do the playbook example

Do pre-check for secondary state then move on to tasks.

## Bit of a rewrite

Need to find a way to conditionally add logging of the hooks!
